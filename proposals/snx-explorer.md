## Title of proposal: 
SNX Explorer

## Description: 
SNX Explorer is a custom block explorer, specifically designed for Synthetix. The first version of the explorer will have 3 sections: 
  1. Wallet overview
  2. Network overview
  3. Transaction view

Below is an outline of all 3 sections. Moreover, there are screenshots in the "Additional Information" section as well:

#### Wallet overview
The wallet overview section will allow users to see the following infromation about any individual Ethereum wallet interacting with Synthetix: 
  - SNX balance
  - Locked SNX
  - Transferrable SNX
  - Synth Balances
  - Wallet debt
  - Wallet c-ratio

#### Network overview
There will also be a network-based table where you can see this information across all the addresses in the Synthetix ecosystem. 

The network overview will split this information across both a SNX holders tab and a Synths holders tab. The synths tab will have an expanded view.

#### Transaction view
The transaction view tab will include information on all of a wallets activities over time, including:
  - Mint
  - Burn
  - Transfer
  - Exchange
  - Claim
  - Depot
  - ETH loan

#### Future features
  - Will request feedback from the community after the initial MVP features above are complete.
  - At the moment I am planning on adding a dashboard page with high level information and charts about the ecosystem. However, this plan will change based on feedback from the community.

## Motivation: 
The goal of SNX Explorer is to improve transparency inside the Synthetix ecosystem. Right now there is not an easy method for users and potential investors to see what is happening on Synthetix. The current dashboard page is helpful for a high level overview, but itâ€™s hard for the average user to track the movement of synths and SNX tokens in the ecosystem.

## Additional information: 
Here are the designs for the MVP which I will build initially before asking the community for feedback about additional features:

## Previous work: 
  - Coding: I am a senior full stack engineer. I was initially onboarded to crypto through NEO and helped to build Neon Wallet (wallet), Neoscan (explorer), and Neon-js (js library like web3). I am currently a senior software engineer for a DEX that supports Ethereum.
  - Writing: I recently wrote a piece on Ethereum found here (https://medium.com/@davidschwartz_34333/2020s-the-rise-of-ethereum-a01a19f806d8). This was a bullish piece but I am going to add a second article soon which goes into more detail on the risks of investing in Ethereum and using various protocols.

## Estimated hours: 
MVP Hours:
- 8 hours planning
- 80 hours building MVP

Optimization work - will go through and optimize the site to improve query performance as needed
- 40 hours

NOTE: this proposal is a one-time request for funds to build the site. This up-front amount requested includes lifetime hosting costs and future work. Additional work on the site will include new features, such as a dashboard, charts, community requested items, etc... 

Furthermore, there will be continual work to keep the site up to date and running properly as the protocol changes. This is likely going to be a small to decent amount of work on a continual basis, while occassionally being more time intensive as new features are added.
- 160 hours

Total: 288 hours

## Price (SNX):
- 20000 SNX for work done (69.44 SNX per hour). 5000 SNX for lifetime hosting costs 
- Total for site: 25000 SNX
- 5000 SNX on approval of project
- 20000 SNX on delivery of MVP

## Ethereum Address: 
- 0xCF51220E21bB23219116075B39F2c30492d23Fe4
